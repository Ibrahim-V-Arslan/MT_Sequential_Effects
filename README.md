# Mouse-Tracking-Experiment_DLAB
This is the work of my internship @ Desenderlab KU Leuven.
## Scripts:
### 1_downsampler.ipynb

### 2_initial-checks.ipynb

### 3_preprocessing.ipynb
### 3.1_manual_preprocessing.ipynb

### 4_averaged_visualizations.ipynb

### 5.1_stim-locked-reg.ipynb

### 5.2_resp_locked.ipynb

Scripts work with number ordering.
This repository could be based on a representative guideline of how to process mouse-tracking data.

## Datasets:

Please contact me via vefa.ars@gmail.com :)

I would be more than happy to share the dataset when needed.
